      <strong>Welcome!</strong> My name is Amanda Parker and I am taking <em>Web Fundamentals</em> (WDD130) during the Winter 2022 semester at BYUI. I married my eternal companion, Brian, in the Washington, DC Temple in 2005. We currently live with
      two of our three children and a rescued dog in Virginia Beach, VA. My oldest child really isn't a child anymore, he is living with my parents and attending a local community college. My only girl, is in 6th grade, loves creating digital art,
      and has started taking an interst in computer programming. My youngest child is in the 4th grade and his favorite companion is a stuffed bison named Pickles.
