    <h1>Amanda's Elevator Pitch</h1>

      I handcraft jewelry that is fun and unique. Because each piece is handcrafted, no two pieces are exactly alike. Take a look at my online portfolio for a sampling of earrings, pendants, and bracelets that I have crafted for myself and others.

    <p>Truly a gift that is as unique and special as she it!</p>
